      In the main menu, players are presented with two options: 
      configuring an **offline game** or setting up an **online game**.


      In the offline **game configuration** screen, players can set up the game by selecting the number of participants.  
      Next to the colored meeple icons, there are input fields for entering 
      player names â€” the color indicates each playe's color during the game.  
      At the bottom right, players can toggle available **expansions** and the optional farming feature.  
      Once everything is set, the game can be started using the large button at the bottom.


      In the online game menu, players can choose to either **host** a game or **join** one.  
      The host must specify the server's IP address for others to connect.  
      Each player needs to select a unique name for the session.  
      The host also has access to the same game configuration options as in offline play.

      The image shows the game right after starting, with all possible expansions enabled.


      On the top left, there is a **table listing all players and their information**.  
      Each row includes the player's name, the number of figures they have for different types, 
      their current score, and the number of goods collected.
      On the top right, the **currently active player** is displayed.


      At the bottom of the screen, the **action bar contains** the available action buttons:
        - The first button is used to **draw a tile**.
        - After placing a tile, **figure placement buttons** become available, allowing the player to place a figure if they wish.
        - The type of placement â€” whether on a tile feature or as a farmer â€” can be toggled using the button with the **grass icon**.
        - At the end of the action bar, there is the **end turn** button.

      In the image, the **deck** can be seen on the game board.  
      The deck contains the player's **unused figures** and the **tiles available for drawing**.


      The tiles with different colors represent different expansions.  
      According to the game's rules, all tiles from **The River** expansion must be placed before other tiles, 
      so these are positioned at the top of the deck.  
      This visual detail helps players track how many tiles remain and plan their strategies accordingly.


      There is also a built-in **deck movement mechanism**:  
      If the placed tiles start to reach the deck during gameplay, 
      the deck automatically moves away to avoid disrupting the game area.

      During the game, players can **freely move the camera** around the play area using the **WASD keys** and **mouse** for rotation.


      Drawn tiles and figures **follow the mouse** to assist with placement.  
      Placeholder **slots** indicate all possible spots for placing tiles or figures.  
      Tiles can be **rotated** with the **middle mouse button**, 
      while figures **automatically rotate** when interacting with a figure slot on the tile.  
      A drawn figure can be **returned to the deck** with the **right mouse button** if not needed.


      The image shows a mid-game state with many tiles and figures placed.  
      It is currently the yellow player's turn: they have already placed a tile in the bottom center and are now moving a meeple.  
      The available placement slots for the meeple are visible on the newly placed tile.

      This image illustrates the **mobile version** of the game, with all expansions disabled.


      Without the use of a keyboard and mouse, the game mechanics differ from the desktop version:
        - **Touching the left side** of the screen **moves the camera**, while **touching the right side rotates it**.
        - The drawn tiles and figures **follow the center of the screen**.
        - **Helper buttons** on the right side of the screen allow for tile and figure placement, tile rotation, and figure cancellation.
