  title: Backend architecture
  icon: 📐
  description: >
    The backend architecture, built with ASP.NET Core, 
    follows a modular layered design to support both client applications. 
    Requests are handled by the ASP.NET Router and processed by Controllers, 
    which delegate to the Business Logic Layer for domain-specific operations.


    Entity Framework Core is used for data persistence, 
    with a Data Access Layer managing interactions with an MSSQL database that stores the application's structured data.


    Security is managed via ASP.NET Identity, Authentication, and Authorization, 
    ensuring secure user access and role-based permissions.


    For static and binary data, disk storage is used to manage invoice files, food images, and other resources.
