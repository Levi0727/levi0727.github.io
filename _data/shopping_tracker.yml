  - title: Authentication
    icon: 🔑
    description: >
      The application supports three authentication methods: guest access, email + password, and Google Auth.


      With **guest authentication**, users can explore the basic features of the app, including shopping lists and storage management. 
      However, guest users cannot share or be invited to households, nor can they access premium features like 
      recipe generation, product submission, and in-app notifications.


      Guests have the option to delete their account or upgrade to a full account 
      by registering with an email + password or linking a Google account.

  - title: Shopping List
    icon: 🛒
    description: >
      Shopping List is the first of three main screens accessible via the bottom navigation. 
      This screen allows users to view their items in two distinct sections:
        - **To buy**:
          - Displays items yet to be purchased.
          - Tapping an item moves it to the *Bought* section.
          - Items can be deleted using the trash icon.
        - **Bought**:
          - Shows items that have already been purchased.
          - The trash icon deletes the item.
          - The right arrow icon navigates to a screen where the user can optionally 
            set an expiration date by scanning the barcode or using a date picker.

      This separation helps keep the interface clear and transparent. 
      Users can toggle between sections using the button at the end of the header row.

      To add items, users can tap the **add button** in the bottom-right corner. Two options will appear:

        1. The first opens a **dialog** where users can quickly set a name and an optional quantity for the product.

        2. The second opens the **Add Shopping Item screen**, as shown in the image. 
          Here, users can explicitly specify the item they want to add by searching for it or scanning the barcode.

  - title: Storage
    icon: 🧺
    description: >
      **Storage List** is the screen where users can view all the items they have added to the household. 
      Items are **organized into sections** based on product categories.


      Next to each section name, there may be an icon indicating the expiration status of the items in that section:
        - **Warning**: At least one item in the section will expire in 3 days.
        - **Error**: At least one item in the section has already expired.

      **Items can be sorted** by name or expiration date, in either ascending or descending order, using the action bar at the top of the screen. 
      This bar also includes buttons for opening the **charts** and adding a **new storage item**. 
      The floating action button at the bottom center navigates to the **recipe generator screen**.


      Actions available on the item cards:
        - **Tap**: Opens the item details, where you can edit it.
        - **Shopping cart button**: Quickly adds the item to the shopping list.
        - **Swipe left-to-right**: Deletes the item.
        - **Swipe right-to-left**: Adds the item to the shopping list and deletes it.
        - **Alarm button**: Set a custom reminder for the item, which will send a push notification. *(in development)*

  - title: Scanning
    icon: 🔍
    description: >
      **Scanning** barcodes and expiration dates can be done in multiple places throughout the app, 
      making it quicker and easier to add new items. 
      These features are accessible via the **scan icon** on the corresponding screens.


      When scanning, a **camera preview** is opened, allowing the user to capture the barcode or expiration date. 
      Below the preview, the results are displayed in a list, from which the user can select the correct one. 
      This step is necessary due to the potential uncertainty of image scanning.


      The first image shows the layout of the **barcode scanning screen**. 
      In the GIF next to it, you can see the **Move item to storage screen**, where the **scan button** 
      for the expiration date is located next to the date picker.

  - title: Charts
    icon: 📊
    description: >
      **Charts** provide a visual representation of the current state of the storage, helping users gain insights at a glance.

        - The **pie chart** displays items grouped by category, with each segment representing the items in a specific section.
        - The **stacked bar chart** shows items grouped by expiration intervals and categories. 
          The columns represent the following **intervals**, and only those with at least one item are displayed:
          - Not set
          - Expired
          - Expires in 1-3 days
          - Expires in 4-7 days
          - Expires in 8-14 days
          - Expires in 15-30 days
          - More than 30 days

      **Tapping and holding a section** of the pie chart or a column of the bar chart will display the label of the group, 
      as well as the number of items by category within that section or column. 
      This can be seen on the image containing the bar chart.

  - title: Recipe Generator
    icon: 🍳
    description: >
      The Recipe Generator uses **Gemini AI to create recipes** that are guaranteed to include at least one 
      selected item from the user's storage, while also allowing for the inclusion of other ingredients.


      Users can **select the item to include** using a search bar, and the selected item will be displayed as shown in the first image. 
      In addition to the ingredient, users can also **select the type of dish** they want to prepare.


      The generated recipe includes a name, an ingredient list, and preparation steps. 
      Next to each ingredient, an **icon indicates whether the ingredient is available** in the user's storage, 
      making it easier to see which ingredients they already have for the dish.


      This feature helps users **discover new dishes** and encourages them to **use items** from their storage **that are expiring soon**.

  - title: Products
    icon: 🍎
    description: >
      On the **Products screen**, users can view their recently used products and 
      browse the product database using the **search bar**, which also **supports speech-to-text** functionality.


      Users can **create new products** by providing a product name, selecting a category, 
      and optionally setting a barcode and uploading an image. 
      This process is shown in the second image, which depicts the product edit screen (the same as the create product screen). 
      Initially, a **newly created product is available only within the selected household**.


      Once all properties of a product are set, the **user can submit the product for verification** by 
      clicking the blue arrow button in the top-right corner of the product card in the list. 
      Verifications are **evaluated by admin users**.
      **Verified products become available across all households, for every user** throughout the app. 
      This feature enables the community to collaboratively build a large and diverse product database.

  - title: Households
    icon: 🏠
    description: >
      Users can create **multiple households** to manage their different storages separately. 
      The app includes a **navigation drawer** that displays all the households associated with the user, 
      and new households can be created here. 
      Switching between households is done by tapping on the desired household's card.


      Each household has an edit screen where users can change its name and **invite others to join**. 
      The household can also be deleted from this screen by tapping the trash icon 
      and confirming the deletion in the confirmation dialog that appears.

  - title: Household invitation
    icon: ✉️
    description: >
      The **household owner can send invitations** to other users, generating an **in-app notification** for the invited user. 
      The recipient can then either **accept** or **decline** the invitation. Since every user has a unique email address, 
      sending an invitation only requires the recipient's email.


      **Invited users** (members) of a household cannot edit or delete the household, but they can **view the members** within it. 
      They also have the option to **leave the household** at any time.

  - title: Notifications
    icon: 🔔
    description: >
      In-app notifications are used to send **household invitations** and **submission evaluation responses**. 
      The notifications screen contains three pages:

        1. The first page shows all notifications, divided into two sections: **New** and **Seen**.
        2. The second page displays only **invitations**.
        3. The third page shows **submission results**.

      **Invitations can be opened**, allowing the recipient to see who sent the invitation and either **accept** or **decline** it. 
      If the invitation is accepted, the recipient will be added to the related household as a member.

      Submission result notifications are triggered when an admin evaluates a product submission made by the user. 
      The notification **informs the user about the admin's decision**. 
      If the product is **accepted**, the notification can be opened, revealing the **verified product** along with its details.
