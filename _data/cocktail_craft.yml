      This screen displays **10 randomly selected cocktails** to the user.
      The list can be refreshed using **pull-to-refresh on Android**, 
      or by clicking the refresh button at the bottom of the screen on desktop, 
      as pull-to-refresh is not an intuitive feature for desktop users.
      If there is no network connection, refreshing will display the last locally cached list.

      At the top of the screen, there's a **search bar** that allows users to find specific cocktails by name.
      On Android, the search bar also **supports speech-to-text** input.
      When offline, search results are limited to the cocktails that were previously cached.

      Favorited cocktails are cached locally and remain available in offline mode.


      If there is no network connection and the data has not been cached, 
      a placeholder message is shown, as illustrated in the second image.

  - title: Adaptivity
    icon: 🧩
    description: >
      The application features an **adaptive layout** that adjusts **based on the available screen size**.
      Beyond the mobile layout, alternative designs are shown to better **utilize larger screens**, 
      as demonstrated in the following images.


      The first image displays the Details screen on a desktop with a narrow window.
      Here, the cocktail image and its **details are arranged in two columns**.


      As the window width increases, a **third column appears, showing the cocktail list** alongside the details.
      This provides a more comfortable browsing experience, as shown in the second image.
