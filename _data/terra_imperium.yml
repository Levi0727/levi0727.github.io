    **GameCore** is responsible for handling all **game logic**, 
    including player actions, state updates, and the enforcement of **game rules**. 
    All other modules interact with the GameCore either directly or indirectly.


    The **View** component represents the **two UI interfaces** built using Unity. 
    The first one was originally created as part of the team project for **human players** to play the game locally. 
    The second one is the user interface of the **replay system**, where users can watch previously played matches.


    The **Resources** component contains all the necessary file resources, 
    such as **configuration files**, **generated map files**, and **log files**. 
    These resources are essential for both logging and loading games.


    The **LogView** module represents the logging mechanism. 
    At the start of a game, it saves the paths of the **configuration file** and the **selected map file**, 
    and during gameplay, it **captures every player action** required to make the game replayable later.


    The **Network** module represents the **game server**. 
    It manages **connections with external AI agents**, referred to as **Clients**. During matches, 
    it sends the current game state to the clients and receives their chosen actions. 
    It also transmits the necessary data for AI agents to make decisions during gameplay.


    **Clients** are external, containerized AI agents that connect to the game server via the Network module. 
    They are platform-agnostic and only need to implement the required communication interface to participate in matches.


    Finally, the **WebServer** component hosts a web portal where 
    authenticated users can **upload AI agents** and **view tournament results**. 
    It also offers administrative functionalities, allowing admins to 
    **manage user accounts** and **configure and start tournaments**.

      This image showcases a moment from a game played by 4 players. 
      The map is populated with various **buildings and troops**, 
      with UI elements above them displaying their type and the player they belong to. 
      Below the UI element, there is a health bar for each unit.


      Troops have **unique stats**, including movement points, health points, attack damage, and attack range. 
      Passive troops have **special abilities**: builders can construct buildings, and settlers can establish new cities.


      Different buildings produce **various resources** and can only be placed next to a city. 
      Troops are trained in cities, with the exception of boats, which are trained at a harbor building.


      Both buildings and troop training **require resources** to be constructed and maintained.

  - title: Tech Tree

    description: >
      The tech tree provides various **upgrades for players**, which can be purchased using resources.
      These techs can **unlock new buildings and troops**,
      provide **stat upgrades** for unlocked units, and grant **additional abilities**.
      Techs are **interdependent**, and their color indicates their level.
      Techs that have already been learned are colored green, while the currently selected tech is highlighted in purple.

      In the image, the tech tree is shown with the _Banking_ technology currently selected.
      The **resource cost** for the selected tech is displayed in the bottom right corner.

  - title: Replay

      The replay view uses simpler assets to present the game clearly, making it easy to follow the action.


      At the bottom, there are buttons to control the replay.
      There is a **discrete mode** where the user can step through the replay using the given buttons.
      In **continuous mode**, the replay progresses automatically over time, but it can be paused at any moment.
      The camera can be moved freely to explore the game area, just as in the main game.


      In the image, the current action is a **move event**.
      The **tiles on the map are highlighted** to indicate the starting and ending points of the movement.
      There is also an **action bar** that provides detailed information about the action taking place.


      The top bar displays the current player and their resources, similar to the main game.
      On the right, the tech tree for the current player is shown, and it can be opened or closed using the button underneath.

  - title: Tournament
    icon: 🏆
    description: >
      On the web portal, admin users have the ability to configure tournaments.


      There is a list containing the **uploaded AI files**, allowing the admin to select which clients will participate in the game. 
      Next to this list, the admin can also **choose the map file** to be used during the tournament. 
      Once selected, a **preview of the map** is displayed on the right.


      Tournaments have two modes:

      - **League Mode**: In this mode, every **AI plays against every other AI**. 
        The **number of matches can be set**, and for each win, an AI earns one point. 
        At the end of the tournament, the **AI with the most points is the winner**.

      - **Knockout Mode**: In knockout mode, **AIs are paired up** and play against each other. 
      The **winner progresses to the next round**, while the **loser gets eliminated**. 
      This mode can only be started with a number of AIs that is a power of two.


      The **number of rounds per game can also be limited** to shorten the length of the tournament. 
      After all rounds are completed, the **game calculates a score** based on the resources collected and determines the winner.
